    <h1>Icy Ice</h1>
    <img src="./Ice.png" alt="Some delicious Boots n Shoes">
    <p>This dish is a very special one to me, it comes from my grandmother's grandmother's grandmother's brother
        <br>who found it engraved on a wood piece in a house he robbed. It all involves the coldest feeling you
        <br>will ever experience, but at the same time heart warming, only for the strong people though.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>This dish is harder to make, but it will be do-able by even you, with a little bit of training and maybe
        <br>a few failed attempts. Just remember, never give up and try your hardest!
